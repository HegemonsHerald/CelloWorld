∙ find a way to convert the result int into the actual exponent
∙ write up a file explanation.c that walks through the bitmasking process for the
  separation of the ieee float into its components using an example and lots of
  helpful output
∙ actually do the tasks, that is: make your new code fit the task
   ✓ potentially find a way to do the whole thing MSB-agnostic...
      → used type casting to function arguments: the vars don't have to be unsigned
        but when passed to to_float() they are treated as if they were!
