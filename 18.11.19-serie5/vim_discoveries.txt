Turns out substitution is really cool.


Look under :h sub-replace-special for all the special tokens in the replace string
 &		replace with the whole matched pattern
 ~		the replace string from the last call to substitute

 \0...\9	for use with \(\) capture groups in the pattern



Look under :h pattern for the EBNF defintion of regular expressions
and all the supported special characters. Vim supports all of the common POSIX 3
regex items, including words and capture groups. I havn't seen advanced lookaraound.
